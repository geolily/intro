 <body>
    This is not as hard as I thought.

   <! –– create an HTML element that we will style with CSS, and use to perform JavaScript tasks. We are calling this container "mapid", but we could have called it whatever you wanted.––>
<div id = "mapid"></div>

<! ––CSS that will describe the size of the mapid container––>
<style>
#mapid{width: 900px; height: 500px;}
</style>


<script>
// this means that the following lines will be script
// (it could also point to an external script file). 

var map = L.map('mapid').setView([35.91, -79.05], 13);
// you can change the zoom
// this line is creating the variable map by initializing the L.map class (a Leaflet class) with the mapid element that we created before. setView is a method that can be applied to the class L.map : you can give it a latitude, longitude and a zoom. The higher the value of the zoom, the finer the initial scale of the map.

L.tileLayer('https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/rastertiles/voyager_nolabels/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png', {
    attribution: '&copy; <ahref="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'}).addTo(map);
// L.tileLayer can display a tile layer. The location of the tile layer needs to be in single quotes. You can also indicate the attribution for that layer. The '&copy; <a> and the other information you see here is HTML code adding a copyright sign, and making a hyperlink to OpenStreetMap.
// At the end we include .addTo(map), which is indicating to add the tile layer to the variable map.

L.marker([35.911271, -79.049807]).addTo(map)
    .bindPopup('Hey I am at Hurston Hall 322') // You can change the message
    .openPopup();
// making a pin located at Latitude 35.911271 and Longitude -79.049807
// wrote the .addTo(map) to indicate that this needs to be added to the map
// .bindPopup indicates that a popup with the message 'Hey I am at Carolina Hall 322' should be attached.
// .openPopup is indicating that it should open a popup when clicked and close the rest.


L.geoJSON(uncwell).addTo(map)

// end of script
